# Vue Heroku Starter

## Get started

1. From inside the project root, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. Next, use `npm run dev` to run it locally.
3. To create your project to heroku, run `heroku create <MY_APP>`. You'll need the `heroku-cli` installed for this. Read about setting that up [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#npm).
4. To deploy your project to heroku, run `git push heroku master`

*Make sure before you push to Heroku, you run `npm run build`.*

### Having trouble?
If you haven't read the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/netscape/deploying-a-vue-js-2-x-app-to-heroku-in-5-steps-tutorial-a69845ace489), you should do so.
